//: ## Writing better code with Swift
//: -----
//: ### Info
//:
//: - __What__: We will go through few of the modern features Swift supports
//: - __Why__: To think about our toolset differently, and to write slightly better/expressive code
//: - __Who__: While the general concepts could probably be applied to any modern programming language (I'm looking at you, `Kotlin`), this session will talk strictly about `Swift`, and prior knowledge of the language is highly recommended
//:
//: -----
//: ### Topics
//:
//: - [Higher Order Functions](Higher%20Order%20Functions) (`forEach`, `reduce`, `compactMap`, etc.)
//: - [Pattern Matching](Pattern%20Matching) using `switch`/`case`/`where`/`is`
//: - A bit more about [`enum`s](Enums)
//: - Better performance [using `lazy`](Using%20Lazy)

//: ### Questions?
//: Feel free to jump in with relevant questions as we go though the session. Otherwise, feel free to reach out to me over:
//: - A cup of coffee
//: - A friendly game of ping pong
//: - TribalScale's Slack(#platform-ios or @Marwan)
